    id: 3,
    question: "What is reseller hosting?",
    answer:
      "Reseller hosting is a service where you purchase hosting resources from a provider and resell them to your clients under your own brand. It lets agencies, freelancers, and entrepreneurs run a hosting business without managing physical servers.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "How does reseller hosting work?",
    answer:
      "With reseller hosting, you get a master control panel like WHM to create and manage individual client accounts. You control disk space, bandwidth, and features while your hosting provider handles server infrastructure and maintenance.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Which hosting is better, reseller hosting or VPS?",
    answer:
      "Reseller hosting is simpler, with server management handled for you. A VPS offers root access and more control but requires technical knowledge. Reseller hosting is better for client management and ease of use, while VPS hosting suits advanced users needing full customization.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How to start a reseller hosting business?",
